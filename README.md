# My_Verilog_IPs
This repository holds all of my custom IPs developed for Verilog projects. All
IPs contained here were written and developed by me for use in my personal FPGA
projects. I do not guarantee that these IPs are flawless, as they are only
tested when I implement and run them in projects. These were written for the
sole purpose of allowing myself to learn, experiment, and explore digital
design for the sake of gaining personal experience with FPGAs and Verilog.
These IPs are all publically available under the Solderpad Hardware License
V2.1, a modified version of Apache V2.0 designed to better include hardware and
hardware description languages.
